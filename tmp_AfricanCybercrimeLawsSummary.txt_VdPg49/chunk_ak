2. Practical Overlap in Modern Governance
In many parliamentary systems (e.g., the UK), ministers are part of both the
executive and legislature
, blurring the lines.
In presidential systems like Nigeria's or the U.S., while the
separation is clearer on paper
, real-world practices like
executive influence over the legislature
or
judicial appointments by the executive
show significant
interdependence
.
3. Nigerian Context Adds Further Complexity
Traditional systems (Yoruba, Urhobo) didn’t strictly separate powers, but practiced
balance through consensus and consultation
.
The
Nigerian Constitution
separates powers formally (Sections 4–6), but
political realities
(e.g., party dominance, weak institutions) make actual separation difficult.
The
Executive often controls the legislature
via party lines, and
the Judiciary may be undermined
by budgetary dependence or political appointments.
4. The Functional Challenge
Which powers need strict separation?
Should financial appropriation and oversight be strictly legislative?
Should the executive control all policy implementation without interference?
To what extent should courts review legislative or executive decisions?
There’s no universal answer—it’s context-driven.
5. Your Core Argument
The doctrine of separation of powers, though foundational, is not a rigid blueprint. It’s difficult—perhaps impossible—to draw definitive boundaries around legislative, executive, and judicial roles, especially in evolving democracies like Nigeria where political culture, institutional maturity, and historical traditions all shape how power is distributed and exercised.

Dijiste:
I just meant there are now governing bodies with global reach
ChatGPT dijo:
Ah, got it! You're pointing out that
in today's interconnected world
, the idea of separation of powers becomes even more complex because
governance isn't confined within national borders anymore
.
Here’s how you might express that insight more clearly in your paper or discussion:
Modern Complexity: Global Governance and the Blurring of Powers
In the contemporary era, it is increasingly difficult to determine which powers should be separated,
not only because of internal constitutional dynamics but also due to the rise of governing bodies with global reach
. Institutions such as the
United Nations
,
World Bank
,
World Trade Organization
,
African Union
, and even
tech giants
like Meta or Google, now influence national policies, legislation, and rights enforcement—often beyond the direct control of any single arm of a national government.
This
global dimension of governance
introduces new layers of authority and influence, challenging the classical notion of separation of powers, which was designed primarily for
nation-states
. For example:
International courts can
overrule national judicial decisions
or
influence domestic legal reforms
.
Trade and financial bodies can
impose policy frameworks
that bind national legislatures.
Digital platforms can
regulate speech
more effectively than local governments, raising questions about
who governs expression
in cyberspace.
In this environment,
power is dispersed
, not just across branches of government, but also across
national and transnational actors
, making the application of the doctrine of separation of powers far more
complex and fluid
than its original form.
