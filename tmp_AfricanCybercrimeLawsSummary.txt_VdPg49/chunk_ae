The Oguedion is the council or committee of persons conferred with Chieftaincy titles and Elders, 
it is in every community, its role in conflict prevention and resolution includes assigning quarters 
to the warriors (Inotu) for defense, handling trials as jury and prosecutors, and pronouncing

Colonial and post-independence evolution 
After independence, the 1960 and 1963 parliamentary constitution, operated the British concept of 
separation of powers whereby powers were shared between the judiciary on one side and the 
parliament and the executive on the other; The latter being an integral through distinct of the

Evolution of separation of powers in United Kingdom 
The relationship between the doctrine of separation of powers and that of the 1215 magna carta 
can be likened to that of a descendant and progenitor. The document contained 63 clauses, each 
outlining various rules. Among these provisions, one stated that the king could not impose new 
taxes without the consent of the barons.12 Additionally, a council of 25 barons was established to 
ensure the king adhered to the terms of the charter.13 This clearly demonstrates that the Magna 
Carta’s primary goal was to limit the king’s power, preventing an excessive concentration of 
authority in the monarchy. 
Additionally, the Bill of Rights 1689 was instrumental in advancing the separation of powers in 
the United Kingdom. It introduced the principle of parliamentary supremacy, making Parliament 
the ultimate source of law-making, surpassing the monarch and the courts.14 The Bill also made it 
unlawful to prosecute individuals in the courts for matters unless approved by Parliament.
