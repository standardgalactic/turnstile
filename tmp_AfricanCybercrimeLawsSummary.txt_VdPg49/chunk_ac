legislature
, and
judiciary
.
Inspired by
Locke
,
Montesquieu
, and
Madison
, this doctrine aims to prevent
tyranny
and promote
accountability
through
checks and balances
.
2. Historical Roots of the Doctrine in Nigeria
The concept existed even in
pre-colonial systems
, such as the
Yoruba Oyo Empire
, where governance was
not centralized
and
power was shared
among different institutions (like the Alaafin, Oyo Mesi, and Ogboni).
Colonialism disrupted indigenous systems but laid the groundwork for Nigeria’s current
constitutional structure
.
3. The 1999 Constitution Formalized the Doctrine
Nigeria’s 1999 Constitution firmly enshrines the separation of powers among the three arms of government.
It empowers the judiciary for
judicial review
, the legislature for
oversight
, and holds the executive
accountable
.
4. Benefits of Separation of Powers
Helps
curb arbitrary rule
and promotes
transparency and accountability
.
Enables
independence of institutions
, thereby protecting
citizens’ rights
and democratic governance.
5. High Cost of Governance is a Major Drawback
Nigeria’s
bicameral legislature
(Senate and House of Representatives) is expensive to maintain.
The
National Assembly budget
continues to grow, raising questions about fiscal responsibility and
economic sustainability
.
There is
duplication of roles
, and high expenditure on salaries, allowances, and bureaucracy.
6. A Call for Reform: Unicameral Legislature
The paper argues that Nigeria should consider a
unicameral legislature
to cut costs.
This would reduce
redundancy
and enhance
efficiency
, while still upholding the
core elements of checks and balances
.
7. Constitutional Amendment as the Way Forward
Recommends a
constitutional amendment
to transition from a bicameral to a
unicameral legislature
.
Proposes a leaner government structure that retains
legislative effectiveness
and
democratic accountability
without the current financial burden.

The Yoruba pre-colonial system of separation of powers: 
The doctrine of separation of powers as practiced by the then Oyo- empire was 
premised on the YORUBA Adage which say that: 
(I) Agbajowo Lafi nsoya, ajeje owo kan ko gberu don. 
(ii) Akil fee mefi Laba Alade — eni fojesu koni mumi. 
(iii) Enikan kiije awade, Igi kan kole da igbo Se. 
Meaning that, no man is an island to himself and cannot be all in all1 
Additionally, the Yorubas had different arms of Government that performed different functions 
Alaafin: he was the political head chosen by the oyomesi then 2 
Oyomesi; the king makers responsible for choosing the Alaafin 
Ogboni society: vested with judicial powers and was involved in policy making 3 
The Osorun or Iba Osorun (Basorun, i.e., the lord that performs the "Oran ") may be regarded as 
the Prime Minister and Chancellor of the kingdom and something more. He is not only the 
president of the council, but his power and influence are immeasurably more significant than those
