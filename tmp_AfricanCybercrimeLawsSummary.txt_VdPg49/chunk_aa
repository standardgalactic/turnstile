## ABSTRACT
The rise in Africans involvement in cybercrimes globally due to increased access to the internet has prompted some African governments to enact ICT and Cybercrime related Laws. Unfortunately, some provisions of these laws, criminalize some expressions and are likely to stifle and restrict online activities and freedom of expression of Africans. This paper argues that the criminalization of certain expressions by these laws are contrary to the expectations of international and regional instruments on freedom of expression. It recommends the adaptation of the experiences and jurisprudence of the European and Inter-American Courts.

## 1. Introduction
Today, Africans have increased their utilization of the internet in carrying out tasks instead of being restricted to the initial three-way communication system, of in-person meeting, phone interaction, or sending a postal message. With the internet communication has become faster and easier and information has become more accessible. Also, information dissemination is with ease and the speed at which information is shared is with a blink.[Footnote1](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/KPWBYNFSGXJTZMAWSDMD/full?target=10.1080/13600834.2024.2406680#) According to the African Union (AU), the African continent has the fastest internet penetration from a global perspective.[Footnote2](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/KPWBYNFSGXJTZMAWSDMD/full?target=10.1080/13600834.2024.2406680#) Again, Africa recorded 566.14 Million internet users in 2020, compared to 522.81 million in 2019.[Footnote3](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/KPWBYNFSGXJTZMAWSDMD/full?target=10.1080/13600834.2024.2406680#) Despite the immense advantages of cyberspace to Africa, including e-commerce, e-governance, e-learning etc., there is an increase in the involvement of African internet users in cybercrimes, especially internet fraud for financial or commercial gain.[Footnote4](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/KPWBYNFSGXJTZMAWSDMD/full?target=10.1080/13600834.2024.2406680#) These cybercriminals use cyberspace to transform traditional crimes into modern crimes like cybercrimes.[Footnote5](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/KPWBYNFSGXJTZMAWSDMD/full?target=10.1080/13600834.2024.2406680#) They perpetuate these crimes through the instrumentality of the computer, networks, and ICT infrastructure.[Footnote6](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/KPWBYNFSGXJTZMAWSDMD/full?target=10.1080/13600834.2024.2406680#) The African continent is now being seen as a safe haven for the perpetration of cybercrimes.[Footnote7](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/KPWBYNFSGXJTZMAWSDMD/full?target=10.1080/13600834.2024.2406680#) This is because there have been several arrests and prosecutions of Africans in other countries especially in the US. Recently, out of 281 cybercriminals arrested in the US and overseas, the majority of them are Africans, with, 167 from Nigeria, 18 from Ghana, and some from Kenya.[Footnote8](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/KPWBYNFSGXJTZMAWSDMD/full?target=10.1080/13600834.2024.2406680#) Consequently, some African governments have enacted Cybercrimes and ICT Laws to curtail the proliferation of cybercrimes in the African sub-region and its perpetuation by Africans domestically and internationally.
Although, the enactment of these laws is a good development, some provisions of the laws tend to curtail and restrict online acts and freedom of expression of Africans contrary to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) 1966, and the African Charter on Human and People’s Right (ACHPR) 1981. The corollary is that truthful and permissible publications in cyberspace are being tagged as ‘false or fake news,’ ‘defamatory,’ ‘offensive,’ ‘insulting,’ or ‘annoying’ and thereby criminalized and punishable with fines or imprisonment. Unfortunately, some African governments are strategically imploring these laws to hush the views of media practitioners and persons in cyberspace who are opposed to the government in power. This has resulted in the arrest and prosecution of persons within this category. In this regard, the paper raises several questions which it seeks to answer: what is the legal implication of criminalizing online expression by African governments? Are criminal sanctions against legitimate users of cyberspace justifiable? Is this necessary in the context of a democratic African society? Allowing African governments to indulge in these acts simply means denying African rights to use cyberspace effectively to facilitate and hold government accountable and promote the protection of human rights in a democratic state against oppressive regimes.
To forestall the anomalies mentioned above, this paper suggests that African governments should adapt what is obtainable and practiced by the European and Inter-American Courts, where it has been established that existing laws that criminalize online information by regarding the same as ‘false or fake news’ ‘defamatory’ ‘offensive’, ‘insulting’, or ‘annoying’ etc. are disproportionately a violation of the right to freedom to conduct online expression. Moreover, such acts have been held not to be necessary for a democratic society. Hence, the use of criminalization should only be resorted to lastly, especially where there is obvious evidence of a significant threat against other cyberspace users’ enjoyment of online rights. Most preferably, the application of civil procedure and not criminal procedure should be undertaken for redress.
This paper examines how the proliferation of internet users in Africa, has led to an increase in the perpetuation of cybercrimes. It provides information on the rising trend of African users in cyberspace, and the way and manner Africans have taken advantage of the access to the cyberspace to perpetrate cybercrimes (internet fraud), especially against foreigners for financial gain. It thereafter examines the reaction of some African governments by the enactment of ICT and Cybercrime Laws. The paper further notes that some of the provisions of these laws are a flagrant breach of international and regional human rights conventions that are applicable in African states. To avoid the violation of Africans rights, it suggests a resort to and adaptation of the experiences and jurisprudence of the European and Inter-American Courts.

Title:
African’s Right to Use Cyberspace and the Imposition of Criminal Sanction: Rethinking Legislative Criminalization of Online Acts in Africa
Abstract Summary:
The internet's growth in Africa has led to both benefits and increased cybercrime.
In response, many African governments have enacted ICT and cybercrime laws.
However, some of these laws criminalize expressions that should fall under freedom of speech.
The paper argues these laws often breach international and regional human rights standards.
It recommends African states draw from the jurisprudence of the European and Inter-American Courts, using civil rather than criminal remedies for regulating online expression.
Key Points from the Introduction:
Digital Growth in Africa:
Rapid internet adoption with over 566 million users by 2020.
Growth has facilitated easier communication, access to information, e-commerce, and e-learning.
Cybercrime Rise:
Increase in fraud and internet-based crimes, often transnational.
African cybercriminals have been prominently prosecuted abroad, especially in the US.
Government Response:
Several African countries have passed cybercrime legislation.
While well-intentioned, some laws criminalize legitimate online speech.
Human Rights Concerns:
These laws conflict with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, ICCPR, and the African Charter.
Terms like “fake news,” “defamatory,” or “annoying” are used vaguely to suppress dissent and journalism.
Arrests and prosecutions have targeted media and government critics.
Recommendations:
Use civil remedies, not criminal sanctions, to address harmful content online.
Learn from European and Inter-American legal systems which emphasize proportionality and necessity.
Protect freedom of expression as a democratic imperative.

Certain laws
criminalize speech
considered “defamatory,” “fake,” “insulting,” or “annoying.”
