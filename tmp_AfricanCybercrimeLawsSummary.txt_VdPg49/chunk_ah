The way forward proposing a transition into unicameral legislature 
One of the most effective ways to reduce governance costs while maintaining legislative efficiency 
in Nigeria is to transition from a bicameral to a unicameral legislature. Nigeria’s current bicameral 
system, consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives, was designed to provide broad 
representation and ensure adequate checks and balances. However, in practice, this structure has

led to excessive government expenditure, bureaucratic inefficiencies, and unnecessary duplication 
of legislative functions. The high cost of maintaining two chambers, including lawmakers’ salaries, 
allowances, and administrative expenses, has raised concerns about the sustainability of this 
system. 
A unicameral legislature, in which only the Senate assumes full legislative responsibilities, 
presents a more cost-effective alternative. By eliminating the House of Representatives, Nigeria 
can significantly reduce the financial burden associated with running the National Assembly. The 
savings from this reform can be redirected to critical sectors such as education, healthcare, 
infrastructure, and poverty alleviation, ultimately improving the quality of life for Nigerians. 
Additionally, a unicameral legislature will streamline the law-making process, reducing 
bureaucratic delays and ensuring faster passage of essential legislation. 
Internationally, several countries have successfully implemented unicameral legislatures without 
compromising democracy or legislative effectiveness. For instance, Ghana has operated a 
unicameral system since its 1992 Constitution, ensuring both efficiency and adequate 
representation. Similarly, China and Sweden maintain unicameral legislatures that function 
effectively while keeping governance costs low. These examples demonstrate that a well- 
structured unicameral system can achieve legislative accountability without the excessive financial 
burden associated with bicameralism. 
Given Nigeria’s economic realities and the urgent need for fiscal responsibility, transitioning to a 
unicameral legislature is a practical solution. It will not only reduce governance costs but also 
enhance legislative efficiency, strengthen accountability, and ensure a more responsive and 
people-oriented government. However, for this transition to take effect, constitutional amendments 
must be enacted to reflect this structural change. 
For Nigeria to successfully transition to a unicameral legislature, a constitutional amendment is 
required to legally redefine the structure of its National Assembly. The 1999 Constitution (as 
amended) currently establishes a bicameral legislature under Section 47, which states that 
legislative powers shall be vested in the Senate and the House of Representatives. To enable the 
shift to a unicameral system, this provision must be amended to recognize a single legislative 
chamber, ensuring that all legislative powers are vested in one house.

in the section titled:
The Way Forward: Proposing a Transition to a Unicameral Legislature in Nigeria
1. Problem with Nigeria’s Bicameral Legislature
Nigeria currently operates a
bicameral system
: Senate + House of Representatives.
Intended to promote
representation
and
checks and balances
.
However, in practice it has:
Led to
high governance costs
.
Caused
bureaucratic inefficiencies
.
Resulted in
duplication of legislative roles
.
Sparked concerns about the
sustainability
of maintaining two chambers.
2. The Case for a Unicameral Legislature
Proposal:
Retain only the
Senate
to assume
full legislative responsibilities
.
Benefits:
Cost reduction
– Salaries, allowances, and administrative expenses of one chamber eliminated.
Streamlined law-making
– Reduces delays in legislative processes.
Reallocation of resources
– Savings can be channeled into education, healthcare, infrastructure, and poverty alleviation.
Enhanced accountability
– Fewer lawmakers may improve focus, transparency, and responsiveness.
3. Global Precedents Supporting Unicameralism

: Has successfully operated a unicameral system since its
1992 Constitution (Art. 93(1))
