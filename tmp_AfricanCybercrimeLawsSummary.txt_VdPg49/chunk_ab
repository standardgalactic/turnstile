Criminalizing legitimate online behavior is

Such sanctions are
disproportionate responses

6. Better Alternatives Exist
African states should
adopt standards from the European and Inter-American Courts
, which:
Emphasize
freedom of expression
Use
civil, not criminal, remedies
for online harm (e.g., defamation)
Require that limitations on speech be
necessary and proportionate
7. Final Argument: Safeguarding Cyberspace as a Democratic Tool
Access to cyberspace should

SEPERATION OF POWERS IN NIGERIA: BALANCING DEMOCRATIC 
ACCOUNTABILITY AND GOVERNANCE COST 
BY 
DIVINE OVIE IMODJE 
Abstract 
The doctrine of separation of powers is a cornerstone of Nigeria’s governance framework, 
designed to prevent the concentration of authority and ensure checks and balances between the 
executive, legislature, and judiciary. This article traces the historical evolution of separation of 
powers in Nigeria, from pre-colonial political structures to modern constitutional provisions 
under the 1999 Constitution. It critically examines its effectiveness in curtailing arbitrary rule 
through judicial review, legislative oversight, and executive accountability. However, while 
separation of powers upholds democratic principles, it has also contributed to the high cost of 
governance, particularly through the maintenance of a bicameral legislature and the extensive 
financial commitments associated with sustaining government institutions. Given the significant 
economic burden, this paper recommends that Nigeria adopt a unicameral legislature as a cost- 
effective alternative, streamlining governance while maintaining essential checks and balances. 
Using legal analysis, historical references, and contemporary case studies, this paper evaluates 
whether Nigeria’s separation of powers achieves its primary objective of preventing tyranny or 
inadvertently leads to excessive government expenditure.

Introduction 
The doctrine of separation of powers is a core principle in democratic governance that prevents 
the concentration of power in a single entity. Championed by John Locke, Montesquieu, and James 
Madison, this principle ensures that law-making, execution, and adjudication are handled by 
separate institutions. The Nigerian Constitution of 1999 upholds this doctrine, dividing powers 
among the executive, legislative, and judicial arms of government. 
However, while separation of powers promotes checks and balances, its practical implementation 
in Nigeria has raised concerns about governance costs, particularly due to the maintenance of a 
bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Over the years, 
Nigeria’s National Assembly budget has significantly increased, leading to debates on whether the 
system is sustainable. 
This paper explores the historical evolution of separation of powers in Nigeria, its role in 
preventing arbitrary rule, and the financial burden it imposes. The key question is whether Nigeria 
should continue with a bicameral legislature or adopt a unicameral system to reduce governance 
costs while maintaining legislative effectiveness and accountability. The study ultimately 
recommends a constitutional amendment to transition to a unicameral system, ensuring a more 
efficient and cost-effective governance structure.

Pre colonial governance and Government structure 
. Yoruba traditional system 
Separation of powers in Nigeria date back before the colonial era. In pre-colonial governments 
they had their own system of government and how powers were separated. 
The Yoruba pre-colonial system of separation of powers: 
The doctrine of separation of powers as practiced by the then Oyo- empire was 
premised on the YORUBA Adage which say that:
