2. Colonial and Post-Independence Nigeria
Colonial & Early Independence Period (1960 & 1963 Constitutions):
British Parliamentary System:
Inspired by the
Westminster model
.
Blurred separation between
executive and legislature
: ministers were part of parliament.
Judiciary remained distinct
, preserving some separation.
Post-1979 Presidential System (1979 & 1999 Constitutions):
Modeled after the
United States presidential system
.
Clearly defined powers under the 1999 Constitution:
Legislative:
National Assembly (Section 4).
Executive:
President and Governors (Section 5).
Judiciary:
Courts (Section 6).
Conclusion:
Nigeria evolved from a
fusion of powers
system to a more
clear-cut separation
, especially under the 1979 and 1999 constitutions.
3. Evolution in the United Kingdom
Magna Carta (1215):
Early limitation of monarchical power
.
Key provisions:
The king
could not impose taxes without baronial consent
.
A council of
25 barons
was established to oversee the king's compliance.
Introduced early ideas of
checks on executive power
, laying the groundwork for
modern separation of powers
.
Bill of Rights (1689):
Institutionalized
parliamentary supremacy
over the monarchy and judiciary.
Made it
unlawful to prosecute individuals without parliamentary approval
, reinforcing the separation between
legislative and judicial functions
.
Conclusion:
The UK’s journey toward separation of powers was
incremental and historically rooted
, emphasizing the
gradual decentralization
of royal authority.
Overall Insight:
Traditional Nigerian systems (Yoruba, Urhobo) featured
functional separation of powers
, though unwritten and based on culture.
Post-colonial Nigeria formally embraced the doctrine via
constitutional provisions
.
Western influences (UK & USA) provided philosophical and structural foundations that shaped Nigeria’s current system.

Dijiste:
Ultimately, the Bill of Rights sought to diminish the king’s authority by granting law-making 
power to Parliament. 
Contemporary perspectives on separation of powers: scholarly insights and debates 
The concept of separation of powers seems to have originated from John Locke’s analysis of the 
political situation in the seventeenth century England.15 John Locke argued that it would be great 
temptation to vest the powers of law making and execution in the hands of one person. Although 
his view on separation of powers is limited to the concept seen today because separation of powers 
entails law making, execution and interpretation. A French jurist and philosopher, Baron De 
Montesquieu, in explaining the concept of separation of powers opined that: ‘’Political liberty is 
to be found only when there is no abuse of powers to prevent this abuse, it is necessary from the 
nature of things that one powers should check on another. When the legislative executive and 
judicial powers are united in the same person or body There can be no liberty … again there is no 
liberty if the judicial power is not separated from the legislative and executive. There would be an 
end of everything if the same person or body, whether of nobles or of the people. Were to executive 
all three powers16. 
Conceding to the foregoing, Madison posited that There can be no liberty where the legislative and 
executive powers are united in the same person or body of magistrates or if the power of judging 
be not separated from the legislature and executive powers.17 
While emphasizing the significance of the principle of separation of powers ,Nigerian renowned 
Professor of constitutional law ,Nwabueze stated that : concentration of governmental powers in 
the hands of one individual is the very definition of dictatorship and absolute power is by its very 
nature arbitrary, capricious and despotic limited government demands therefore, that the 
organization of government should base on some concept of structure, whereby the functions of 
law making, execution and adjudication are vested in separate agencies, operating with separate 
personnel and procedure. We are not prepared, write vile, 'to accept that government can become, 
on the ground of "efficiency", or for any other reason, a single undifferentiated monolithic 
structure, nor can we assume that government can be allowed to become simply an accidental
