of law making, by insisting that every executive action must, in so far at any rate as it affects an 
individual, have the authority of some law, and by prescribing a different procedure for law making 
the arbitrariness of executive action can be effectively checked.18 
A notable decision in of Commissioner for local Government Anambra state v Ezemokwe 19the 
court of appeal gives credence to the foregoing the court of appeal held that under the 1979 
constitution the executive has its own constituted duties just as the judiciary has its own duties. 
Therefore, the judiciary cannot interfere with the right of the executive to perform its duties as 
much as the executive cannot interfere with the judiciary its own duties.

Here’s a
breakdown of the main arguments and scholarly perspectives
from the section you provided on
contemporary views of the separation of powers
:
1. Historical Philosophical Foundations
John Locke:
Viewed
separation of powers
as a safeguard against
tyranny
.
Warned against concentrating
law-making and execution
in one person or body.
His model was
less comprehensive
, excluding the
judicial function
as we understand it today.
Baron de Montesquieu:
Provided a
more robust and modern view
of the doctrine.
Argued that
political liberty exists only when powers are separated
.
Believed that combining
legislative, executive, and judicial functions
leads to
oppression and tyranny
.
Famous quote:
“There is no liberty if the judiciary is not separated from the legislative and executive.”
James Madison (Federalist No. 46):
Reinforced Montesquieu’s stance.
Declared that liberty
cannot exist
when
legislative and executive powers are united
, or when
judicial powers are not independent
.
2. Nigerian Scholarly Insight
Prof. Ben Nwabueze (Renowned Nigerian Constitutional Scholar):
Concentration of government powers in one person equals
dictatorship
.
Absolute power
is inherently
arbitrary, despotic, and dangerous
.
Emphasized that a
limited government
requires:
Law-making, execution, and adjudication to be
separately assigned
.
Different institutions, personnel, and procedures
for each function.
Rejected the idea of a
monolithic government
for the sake of "efficiency".
Argued that by
separating executive actions
from law-making and requiring executive actions to be
authorized by law
,
arbitrariness can be prevented
.
3. Judicial Support in Nigerian Case Law
Commissioner for Local Government, Anambra State v. Ezemokwe:
Court of Appeal’s Position:
Under the
1979 Constitution
, each arm of government has
distinct responsibilities
.
The
judiciary cannot interfere
in the domain of the executive.
Likewise, the
executive cannot interfere
with the judiciary’s duties.
This case supports the
principle of institutional independence
and
non-interference
.
