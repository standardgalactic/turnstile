as supreme is vested with absolute power, yet that power must be exercised within the limit of the 
unwritten constitution, but if he is ultra-tyrannical and withal unconstitutional and unacceptable to 
the nation it is the Basorun's prerogative as the mouthpiece of the people to move his rejection as 
a King in which case His Majesty has no alternative but to take poison and die4. 
It is evident from the above that the pre-colonial Yoruba kingdom had a well-defined separation of 
powers, with each organ of government effectively carrying out its respective functions.

The Urhobo people are a major ethnic group in Delta State, Nigeria, renowned for their vibrant 
culture and traditions. They speak the Urhobo language, which belongs to the Niger-Congo

Here’s a structured breakdown of the
pre-colonial Yoruba and Urhobo systems of separation of powers
, highlighting their contributions to the doctrine in Nigeria's traditional governance:
1. Yoruba Pre-Colonial System of Separation of Powers (Oyo Empire)
Foundational Philosophy:
Based on Yoruba proverbs emphasizing
collective governance
and the
limits of individual power
:
“Agbajo owo la fi n soya, ajeje owo kan ko gberu dori”
– Unity is strength; one hand alone cannot lift a heavy burden.
“Akil fi emeji laba Alade”
– Power should not be concentrated in one individual.
“Enikan kii je awade; igi kan ko le da igbo se”
– One tree does not make a forest.
Institutions and Their Roles:
Alaafin (King):
Political head, but not an absolute monarch. Chosen by the
Oyomesi
.
Oyomesi (Council of Kingmakers):
Appointed the Alaafin, had powers to check him, especially if he ruled tyrannically.
Ogboni Society:
Held
judicial and spiritual power
, contributed to policymaking and acted as a balance against executive overreach.
Basorun (Prime Minister):
Head of Oyomesi.
Wielded significant influence; could initiate the
removal of a tyrannical Alaafin
.
If the king was rejected by the people,
he had to commit ritual suicide
, showing a form of constitutional accountability.
Conclusion:
The Oyo Empire demonstrated a
tripartite system
: executive (Alaafin), legislative/advisory (Oyomesi), and judicial/spiritual (Ogboni).
Power was
distributed
and
checked
, preventing tyranny and ensuring governance legitimacy.
2. Urhobo Pre-Colonial System of Separation of Powers
Cultural Context:
The Urhobo people are an ethnic group in
Delta State
, with strong cultural and governance structures tied to
kinship and community
.
Governing Body: Ovie-in-Council
Ovie (King):
Traditional ruler.
Otota (Spokesman):
Served as the king’s principal adviser and communicator.
Selected Chiefs:
Trusted nobles forming a decision-making council.
Functions:
Decision-making:
The Ovie-in-Council approved all major decisions affecting the kingdom.
Conflict Resolution:
Served as the
highest judicial authority
.
Checks on the Ovie:
Although respected, the king did not act alone; the council's consensus was necessary for governance.
Conclusion:
Like the Yoruba system, the Urhobo system exhibited
shared governance
where
executive, advisory, and judicial roles
were distinguished and balanced.
This helped prevent
abuse of power
and ensured community participation in leadership.
