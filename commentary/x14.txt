quick flick of the wrist to hide the
flaw to keep the illusion alive to keep
the audience clapping instead of asking
questions to keep the show going even
after the light's dim
they play their tells like
rituals hoping no one calls them
out if they let just one card
fall the whole house could come crashing
down and buried beneath it are years
they can never reclaim birthdays
holidays spent inside
pews wildness and Beauty traded for
obedience if one truth turns the Dust
the whole deck is counterfeit and the
hands that held it were only ever
bluffing and they can't bear the thought
that they've been playing a rigged game
since the day they sat down at the table
invited by those they trusted most those
who spoke with unshakable conviction it
was a fixed table from the start the
dealer always divined the outcome always
for ordained so they double down on
verses out of context on polished until
it shines on faith strong enough to
withstand reason too fragile to
withstand a question too brittle to hold
the weight of real love the kind that
welcomes doubt like a friend and asks
nothing in
return they're chasing their losses
now they're caught in a gambler's
fallacy of the Soul they're stacking
their prayers like chips in a losing
streak and when their hands shake when
the doubts creep in when the weight of
the contradictions presses against the
ribs like a tightening belt when every
inhale feels like choosing to lie to
themselves again when their own
reflection begins to ask for answers
they
whisper again and
again I can't stop now I've come too far
I've bet everything on
this as if walking away now would mean
the pain was for nothing instead of the
beginning of everything real instead of
the start of the life they've always
