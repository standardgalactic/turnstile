empty hands and open Palms fingers
curled like the Petals of a wilted
flower trembling with practiced
Grace the pot never grows in their
Direction the odds never shift in their
favor they call it tithing they call it
giving back to God but God has no need
for money only the men who claim to
speak for
him in their silk suits and fancy
watches their million-dollar churches
they preach about humility about
sacrifice about giving till it hurts
they play the house like seasoned sharks
holding a flesh while you bet blind they
say God will
provide but only after you
give after you stretch your paycheck
thin so the church can build another
Monument to itself
and so the Empire of Faith keeps
growing it's a spiritual Casino where
you can only win by losing
more when the money runs low when the
bills stack higher than the hymns when
the fridge is empty but the offering
plate is full they're told give in faith
and it will be returned to you
tenfold as if God runs a business with
matching funds where the Divine takes
IUS with interest
Heaven becomes a payout machine and
faith is just your Lucky Chip and they
give and they wait and they wait and
they wait and nothing comes no
floodgates of Heaven no Divine deposit
into their account no Mana raining from
the sky just the soft Silence of
unanswered devotion the hollow echo of a
promise they keep repeating to
themselves there's no jackpot there's no
cash out just house credit it buys
nothing but they keep digging deeper
because if they were to stop now it
would be admitting that they have funded
their own deception they have been
handing over their labor their time
their dreams to a system that's never
going to pay them
back this is a Sanctified Ponzi
