is enough to keep them locked in chasing
something they will never
get they're on a losing streak disguised
as spiritual growth a cycle of sunk cost
devotion as they watch the pastors the
ones who own the casino who live in the
pen houses above who never seem to
struggle or question or suffer the way
the gamblers do that are never caught
with empty hands or trembling faith that
never wake up with a soul full of
Silence these are the high rollers the
house of God insulated for now from The
Fallout playing with house money while
the others grow broke in spirit and
still they believe they believe because
they have
to they cannot accept the loss they
cannot walk away broke with nothing but
Wasted Years in their hands a lifetime
of offering plates and unanswered
prayers a trail of Sunday spent trying
to buy a heaven that never answered
back the
payout it's the graveyard of receipts
with no Redemption counter and so they
just keep
going sliding another worship service
into the machine pushing another prayer
across the counter swallowing their
doubts and continuing to play the
ridiculous
game what if the game never
ends what if Freedom means walking away
with nothing but the chance to start
again to taste the different kind of
Holiness what if walking away from the
casino floor meant your hands were empty
but
they were finally your
own but the house keeps humming soft and
familiar and the congregation Can't Stop
Singing because it sounds like home even
while it keeps them from ever going
there The House Always Wins especially
when it teaches you to lose
quietly to lose
Faithfully to
lose and call it sanctification and
holiness
