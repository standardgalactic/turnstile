every loss is one step closer to a win
they flip every loss into a coded
message from God they're terrified of
Silence that means
nothing because to admit otherwise is to
feel the floor give way beneath their
Theology and fall through the trapo
where their soul once stood they mistake
their own longing for the voice of
God and like misreading a bluff and
losing everything still claiming it was
a strategy it's like they think yearning
itself is Holy and is Redemptive as if
needing something badly enough can
conjure it into being because the day
that they stop looking for signs is the
day that they have to admit that no one
is sending them and the dealer isn't
crooked there just isn't a dealer there
at all and they've been betting their
breath on an empty seat and so they play
on continuing to turn their Wishful
think into the voice of God they're
shuffling their soul into false hope
when everyone else is doing it it's
easier to keep placing bets than just
walk
away so they spin it all desperate for
divine contact hoping that the next
click the next flick of meaning will
save them from
meaninglessness they're looking for a
jackpot of
assurance always almost they're praying
with a gambler's desperation begging the
universe to please let this one be a
win when the doubts creep in and the
randomness feels too random and the
patterns stop making
sense they whisper not to God but to
themselves I can't stop now I've come
too far I have too much vested in this
this simply has to be
true whether it's true or
not there are too many chips down too
many false
tells too too much identity at stake too
much eternity tied to fragile guesses
too much sacrificed to stop dancing now
too many lifetimes wagered on a story
