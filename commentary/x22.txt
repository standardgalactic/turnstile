opening his arms a friend becomes a
stranger like smoke slipping through the
cracks of memory once a home now a ghost
each relationship lost like a losing
hand discarded before the turn faith
demands
sacrifice that is the unspoken role
and the altar always wants more it's
never satisfied Never full the dealer
never says enough The Pit Boss never

blood if it costs them their peace if it
costs them the ones who knew them before
the Dogma sank its claws into them then
so be it they'll call it Divine even as
it empties them even as they Echo with
loneliness in the name of God they'll
say they're
winning while losing their ire
bankroll they'll call it righteousness
they'll call it carrying the
cross even though their shoulders ache
with inherited grief grief dressed up as
Glory it's like they think grief is just
a marker in the game it's a token to be
cashed in later for crowns and mansions
they will sit in their empty houses and
tell themselves it was worth
it the ache just means we're
holy to them the pale
was always supposed to be
invisible they will watch their children
walk away watch their brothers and
sisters Fade Into the distance of lives
lived freely where no one is asked to
anti up their soul just to be accepted
and they will say through clenched teeth
through unshed tears the Lord gives and
the Lord takes
away a phrase they like to repeat like a
spell to keep the guilt at Bay to keep
the questions of sleep beneath their
ribs a mantra like a losing Gambler at
the slots mumbling lucky phrases to
machines that never pay but deep in the
night when the prayers were spoken and
the lights are
out when the silence settles in like a
weight on your chest when the ghost of
their mother's laughter their father's
