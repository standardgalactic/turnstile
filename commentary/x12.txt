can't stop now I've come too
far turning back would mean facing the
ghosts of every unanswered play every
tear that fell into that void every
moment they waited for the voice that
never came
came every moment they passed by the
world outside afraid it would betray
their devotion they can't stop
now not because their faith is
necessarily alive or
strong but because the truth might
be and the truth is harder to
carry when you've Bet Your Life on a
whisper admitting the silence was always
silence feels like betrayal not just of
God but of themselves
and yet even now that the wind calls to
them the real world Untouched by
theology cries out with color with chaos
with the aching gift of Being Human and
ask them to live before it's too late to
cash out before the next hand to walk
away from the table while there's still
something left to claim namely
themselves
[Music]
they should
fold they should walk
away the cards on the table don't match
the ones in their
hand but still they Double
Down Eyes Full of hope they no longer
feel hands trembling as they reach out
for one more borrowed
truth it's a cold call on a busted
flush a desperate gamble in that final
round raise the
stakes bet their people peace their
logic their very breath on doctrines
that crumble under the weight of a
single question truths that tremble when
touched like glass stretched too thin to
hold the
heat they're pot committed now stuck in
a game they can't afford to lose
bluffing their way through another
sermon they sit at the table of Faith
pushing all in on the contradictions
stacking scripture like chips balancing
