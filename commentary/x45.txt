is all rigged
but they just have to keep playing they
have to keep saying I can't stop
now I have gambled my life away in this
I have gambled my life and this just has
to be true this has to be a good bet
this has to be a good investment and the
house turns out the
lights
quiet cold
final leaving only the creek of the
empty chairs
the scent of all that might have been
the ghost of what they could have become
if they dared to live if they'd only
pushed back from the table put down
their cards and walked away into the
night with their whole selves intact
they have read the
conclusion many times in their own
Bible if Christ is not raised then they
are of all people to be most
pied again if Christ is not raised then
they are of all people to be most
pied Christians we implore
you
please stop gambling your lives
away over ancient
[Music]
mythology again
see you
