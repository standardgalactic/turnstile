True
# Use a fixed location along the path
follow_path.use_curve_follow =
True
# Enable curve following so the camera rotates along the path
# Adjust the axes: setting FORWARD_Y often works better with cameras
follow_path.forward_axis =
'FORWARD_Y'
follow_path.up_axis =
'UP_Z'
This tells Blender to rotate the camera along the curve’s tangent. If the camera still appears off, you might need to adjust the camera’s initial rotation or experiment with different forward_axis settings. For instance, sometimes using
'FORWARD_Z'
or its negative variant can yield the desired orientation depending on your scene’s layout.
Let me know if you need any further tweaks!

no the z axis is facing down, the camera is looking down at the feet of the columns instead of starting over on the side like on x or y and flying through it

You can try aligning the camera’s natural view direction (which is along its local –Z) with the path by setting the follow path’s forward axis to “-FORWARD_Z” and the up axis to “UP_Y”. For example, replace the follow path constraint section with:
python
Copiar código
# Add a Follow Path constraint to the camera targeting the curve
follow_path = camera.constraints.new(
type
=
'FOLLOW_PATH'
)
follow_path.target = curve_object
follow_path.use_fixed_location =
True
# Use a fixed location along the path
follow_path.use_curve_follow =
True
# Make the camera rotate to match the curve's tangent
# This makes the camera’s natural -Z (its view direction) point along the path.
follow_path.forward_axis =
'-FORWARD_Z'
follow_path.up_axis =
'UP_Y'
If the camera still appears to be looking down, you might also try one of these adjustments:
Adjust the curve or camera starting location:
Ensure your curve’s control points and the camera’s initial location are set so that the camera flies horizontally through the columns rather than from an overhead position. For instance, you could modify the curve’s points to have non-zero Y values.
Add a Track To constraint:
Create an empty positioned slightly ahead of the camera along the path and add a “Track To” constraint so the camera always points toward that empty. For example:
python
Copiar código
# Create an empty for tracking
bpy.ops.
object
.empty_add(
type
=
'PLAIN_AXES'
, location=camera.location)
tracker = bpy.context.active_object
# Add a Track To constraint so the camera always looks at the empty
track_to = camera.constraints.new(
type
=
'TRACK_TO'
)
track_to.target = tracker
track_to.track_axis =
'TRACK_NEGATIVE_Z'
# Camera views along -Z by default
track_to.up_axis =
'UP_Y'
Then, animate or parent the empty so that it remains a short distance ahead of the camera along the path.
These changes should help the camera to fly along the curve in a more horizontal manner rather than facing straight down at the columns’ bases. Adjust the axis settings or the positions as needed to best suit your scene’s layout.

Ok it's not working just take the camera and flight path out.

Below is a simplified Blender Python (bpy) script that creates a scene with a series of vertical columns (cylinders) of random widths and heights. This version removes any camera and flight path setup so you can focus solely on generating the column "forest" or corridor.
python

import

random
# ---------- Clear the scene ----------
bpy.ops.
object
.select_all(action=
'SELECT'

.delete(use_global=
False

# ---------- Create vertical columns ----------
num_columns =

# Adjust the number of columns as needed
