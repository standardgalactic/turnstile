Explanation
Displacement Correction:
The script now creates a noise texture and sets its scale using
disp_texture.scale = 0.5
(instead of using
noise_scale
). The intensity line has been removed because it isn’t supported in Blender 2.93.6.
Camera Creation:
The camera is created manually via a new camera data block and linked to the scene’s collection, ensuring it’s available regardless of context.
Animation Speed:
If the animation still feels too fast, consider either extending the frame range (for example, setting
scene.frame_end
to 1000) or reducing the frame rate in your render settings (e.g.
scene.render.fps = 12
).
Run this updated script in Blender’s Text Editor. You should now see your animated fractal plane with a noise-based color and displacement animation, along with a flyover camera.

Below is an updated version of your script. In this version, we wrap the texture property assignments in try/except blocks so that if those legacy properties aren’t available in Blender 2.93.6, the script won’t error out. (In that case the displacement will use the texture’s default settings.)
