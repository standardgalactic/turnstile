# Optionally, to slow down the animation, you can either extend the frame_end (e.g., to 1000)
# or change the frame rate (scene.render.fps) in the scene render settings.

Explanation
Animation Speed:
The camera (and other animated properties) are keyframed over 500 frames. If the motion still feels too fast, you could:
Increase the frame range (e.g. set
scene.frame_end = 1000
) to lengthen the animation.
Lower the scene’s FPS via
scene.render.fps = 12
(or another value) to slow the playback.
Camera Creation:
Instead of relying on
bpy.ops.object.camera_add
(which depends on context), the script now creates a camera using
bpy.data.cameras.new
and links it manually. This ensures the camera is created and visible in your scene.
Feel free to adjust the frame range or FPS as needed to get the desired animation speed.

Reasoned for 7 seconds
Below is your script with corrections in the displacement section for Blender 2.93.6. In this version, instead of using properties that no longer exist (like
noise_scale
and
intensity
), we set the texture’s scale via the
scale
attribute and omit the intensity setting. You can adjust the keyframes and timeline as needed to slow down the animation.
