Explanation
Material Setup:
• The material uses a Noise Texture → Mapping → Texture Coordinate chain to drive a ColorRamp.
• The ColorRamp now has two stops set to cooler, darker hues:
Element 0:
Starts as a dark teal (0.0, 0.2, 0.3, 1.0) and animates to a slightly lighter teal before reverting.
Element 1:
Starts as a cyan (0.1, 0.8, 0.8, 1.0) and shifts slightly toward a blue-green (0.0, 0.75, 0.85, 1.0).
Displacement:
• A Displace modifier with a noise texture is added and animated over 500 frames.
• Legacy texture properties are attempted (with a fallback if not available).
Camera & Lighting:
• A new camera is created and animated along a flyover path.
• A sun lamp is added for illumination.
Render Settings & Viewport Update:
• The render resolution is set to 1920×1080, and the Eevee engine is used.
• The scene camera is set, and the viewport is forced to update and align to the camera.
Run this script in Blender’s Text Editor. It should produce a fractal plane with a cooler, blue–cyan–green palette and a darker overall look. Adjust the color values or keyframe timings further to fine-tune the appearance as desired.
