# Finished! Play the animation to see your boids fill a large 3D volume.
How It Works
3D Emitter:
Instead of a plane, we use a cube (size 40) so particles are spawned from within a large volume.
Volume Emission:
The particle system is set to emit from the volume, allowing birds to originate anywhere within the cube.
Boid Physics:
Basic boid rules (follow, avoid, and flock) drive the simulation, now with increased speed and acceleration for a more dynamic flight in a larger space.
3D Goal & Turbulence:
An animated empty moves through 3D space to guide the swarm, while a turbulence force field adds random motion for extra visual interest.
Enjoy exploring this more expansive, three-dimensional boid simulation!
Dijiste:
Ok it seemed good but I can't see anything at the points is it possible to import an object tetraorthodrome.obj to put at each of the points you might have to make them smaller. Maybe try to specify that it is in the folder C:\Users\Mechachleopteryx\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\Centerfuge

Below is a modified Blender Python (bpy) script that imports your custom object from the specified folder, scales it down, and then uses it as the instance object in a boid simulation. In this example, a cube emitter emits particles throughout a 3D volume, and each particle is replaced by your imported object (tetraorthodrome.obj). Adjust the scale and other parameters as needed.
