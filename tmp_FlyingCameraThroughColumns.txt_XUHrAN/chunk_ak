How It Works
Importing the Object:
The script imports your custom
tetraorthodrome.obj
from the specified folder. It then scales the object down so that it fits well when instanced as a particle.
Cube Emitter:
A large cube emitter is created so particles are spawned throughout a significant 3D volume.
Particle System:
The particle system is configured to emit from the volume of the cube, and it uses your imported object for each particle.
Boid Physics & Goal:
Boid settings are applied to simulate flocking behavior. A moving empty (goal) is animated in 3D space to influence the boid dynamics, while a turbulence force field adds randomness.
Timeline:
The scene’s timeline is set up so you can play the animation to see the simulation evolve.
Run this script in Blender’s Scripting workspace, then press
Play
in the timeline to observe your custom objects in a 3D boid simulation. Enjoy tweaking the parameters for even more interesting behavior!
Dijiste:
Ok it just imported one and it didn't move. It will need to be smaller and maybe spinning rappidly. Try to link them with the particle locations.

Reasoned about imported objects and particles for 24 seconds
Below is a revised Blender Python script that imports your custom tetraorthodrome.obj, scales it down, and then uses it as the instance object for a boid particle system. In this version we enable particle rotation (so each instance inherits its particle’s rotation) and add a vortex force field to help make the objects spin rapidly. Each instance is linked to its particle location, so they follow the boid simulation. Adjust the parameters as needed.
