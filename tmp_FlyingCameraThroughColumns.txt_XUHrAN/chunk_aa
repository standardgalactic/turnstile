I wonder if you can make me a scene in blender with a camera flying of a bunch of vertical columns of different widths and heights like flying through a forest or a death star using bpy python

Below is an example Blender Python (bpy) script that clears the scene, creates a bunch of vertical columns of various widths and heights (like random "trees" or columns), and then sets up a camera that flies along a curved path through them. You can run this script in Blender’s scripting workspace.
