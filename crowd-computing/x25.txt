So if you just search for Bowling Green, 
uh, Kentucky, uh, sensemaking, uh, or polis,  
uh, or better Bowling Green, uh, you can see 
exactly how it's done. It's all open source,  
not just the P platform, but 
also the sensemaking tool. Uh,  
they're all free software free for anyone to 
use. And so there are some US states, uh, with.
Citizen assembly tradition already in 
an in-person kind like in Oregon. Uh,  
and so in that sense then it's not 
about convincing them to move online,  
but rather using digital tools 
to augment the conversation and  
to improve its reach. So like Democracy Next 
has been working with Oregon people on that.
So the Bowling Green and the Oregon, there are,  
there are entities that are working 
and chaperoning that process.
Mm-hmm. But in theory, anyone listening to this 
show could look at the Bowling Green example,  
access the source code, and start 
something in their own community.
Yes,
definitely
you can roll out Polis installations. Uh, 
at PL is, and the sales making tools, uh,  
you just search for Jigsaw, sensemaking and 
Polis, I think now have integrated that logic.
So it can also use language models 
to do a very balanced reporting of  
people's ideas. So you can close 
the loop like literally within,  
um, a minute or so for the mayor, 
uh, to maybe read every morning.
Let, let me ask you a, a related question. 
Not, uh, to do with democracy per se. Um,  
but I've noticed, um, over the years, 
um, decades of convening groups of.
High status scientists and activists, that 
everyone's got an opinion and they're very smart,  
and you get 80 or a hundred people 
together. But what ends up happening  
is when you're in person or when your 
name is attached to something, people,  
since we're social primates, uh, and we 
compare and look at status metrics, they  
defer to the senior wealthiest, or most famous, 
or most influential per person in the group.
And so they don't mm-hmm. Let their, their
