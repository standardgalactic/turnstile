Want to specify the file via command line? Change your
main()
to this:
python
Copiar c√≥digo
import
sys
def
main
():
if
len
(sys.argv) !=
2
:
print
(
"Usage: python extract_mhtml_text.py <file.mhtml>"
)
return
file_path = sys.argv[
1
]
if
not
os.path.isfile(file_path):
print
(
f"File '
{file_path}
' not found.")
return
print
(
f'Processing
{file_path}
...')
    extracted_text = extract_text_from_mhtml(file_path)
    output_file = os.path.splitext(file_path)[
0
] +
".txt"
with
open
(output_file,
"w"
, encoding=
"utf-8"
)
as
out:
        out.write(extracted_text)
print
(
f"Extracted text written to
{output_file}
")
Then you can run it like:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
python extract_mhtml_text.py my_file.mhtml
Want help cleaning up the output or fixing messed-up smart quotes after the fact? I got you.

A script to extract plain text from a single MHTML file provided as a command-line argument.
It parses the MHTML file as a MIME message, extracts text from its HTML (or plain text) parts,
removes HTML tags using BeautifulSoup, and writes the result to a .txt file.

Usage:
    python extract_mhtml_text.py your_file.mhtml
