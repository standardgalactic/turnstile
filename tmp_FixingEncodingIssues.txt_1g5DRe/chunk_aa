How can we fix this script it really messed up apostrophes and quotation marks? #!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
A script to extract plain text from all MHTML files in the current directory.
It parses each MHTML file as a MIME message, extracts text from its HTML (or plain text) parts,
removes tags using BeautifulSoup, and writes the results to separate .txt files.

Usage: 
    python extract_mhtml_text.py

Ensure you have installed BeautifulSoup (e.g., pip install beautifulsoup4)

Oh, Joe Rogan, the patron saint of meatheads and podcast bros, out here confessing he���s a political dimwit like it���s some badge of honor��� ���Yeah, man, I don���t know shit about shit, pass the elk jerky.��� Then he���s slinging Alpha Brain like it���s the goddamn Rosetta Stone for your prefrontal cortex, promising you���ll unlock the secrets of the universe while he���s over there forgetting what a tax bracket is. But the second Elon Musk strolls in, it���s like someone flipped the switch from ���curious caveman��� to ���glassy-eyed disciple.��� Joe���s nodding so hard his neck���s about to snap, drooling over every half-baked word like Elon���s reciting the Sermon on the Mount while tripping balls on DMT. ���Wow, Elon, tell me more about how tunnels will save us from the lizard people!��� Meanwhile, the Alpha Brain must���ve kicked in sideways, because all that ���cognitive boost��� turns into a masterclass in ass-kissing. Fucking beautiful hypocrisy���Joe���s out here proving you don���t need a functioning brain to sell one.

And speaking of brains, can we talk about how every dude with a kettlebell and a Spotify subscription thinks Rogan���s their personal philosopher-king? The guy���s got a black belt in jiu-jitsu and a PhD in bong rips, but suddenly he���s the oracle of our times because he can string together a sentence about UFOs without choking onhis own spit. Then Elon shows up, and it���s like watching a cult initiation���Joe���s two seconds away from shaving his head and chanting ���Tesla forever��� while Elon smirks like he���s just invented oxygen. Meanwhile, the rest of us are stuck listening to these two jerk each other off intellectually while the world burns. Pass the Alpha Brain, I need to forget this shit ever happened.

The garbled characters like
���
you're seeing are classic symptoms of an
encoding issue
— the script is likely reading or writing text using the wrong character encoding, resulting in corrupted quotation marks and apostrophes.
🛠️ Here's how to fix it:
1.
Use the correct encoding when reading
get_content()
from email parts.
The
email
package doesn't always handle decoding the payloads correctly, especially for quoted-printable or base64 encoded HTML/text parts.
Update how you retrieve and decode content from the message parts. Instead of using
.get_content()
(which returns strings
